As a solo ML engineer, I'm building an app that understands speech with dysarthria, aphasia or apraxia: [https://mailchi.mp/0c6c7713ef3b/be-understood-speech-helper-app-email-waitlist](https://mailchi.mp/0c6c7713ef3b/be-understood-speech-helper-app-email-waitlist)

I mentioned in some time ago that I'm building by myself an app for people with speech sound disorders like dysarthria, apraxia, aphasia etc. Right now I'm throwing my savings into that and doing the research to make it work. Basically, now there are only very pricy solutions ($1300 a year) or free solutions that are bad at understanding non-standard speech. Lots of open research have happened in machine learning and artificial intelligence last months/years, which enable me to create such tool only by myself + some compute credits I have accumulated on Lightning AI by doing free work for them some time ago. If you know anyone with speech difficulties you can [let them know](https://mailchi.mp/0c6c7713ef3b/be-understood-speech-helper-app-email-waitlist) if they need speech recognition tool. It will listen to you and show a transcription on a screen

If you know a:
- person with speech disease
- caregiver
- speech therapist

and you think they could benefit from such tool, you can consider sharing the link to them. Waitlist is here: https://mailchi.mp/0c6c7713ef3b/be-understood-speech-helper-app-email-waitlist
