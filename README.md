I'm building **[an app that understands dysarthric speech](https://beunderstoodapp.com/)**

If you are a:
- person with speech disease (stroke survivors, patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Degenerative Neurological Diseases (e.g., ALS with frontotemporal dementia), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Cerebral Palsy, Huntington’s Disease, Myasthenia Gravis, Brain Tumors and others)
- caregiver
- speech therapist

then [**sign up to the waitlist**](https://mailchi.mp/0c6c7713ef3b/be-understood-speech-helper-app-email-waitlist)
