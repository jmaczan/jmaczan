As a solo ML engineer, I'm building an app that understands speech with dysarthria, aphasia or apraxia:

Right now I'm throwing my savings into that and doing the research to make it work. Basically, now there are only very pricy solutions ($1300 a year) or free solutions that are bad at understanding non-standard speech. Lots of open research have happened in machine learning and artificial intelligence last months/years, which enable me to create such tool only by myself + some compute credits I have accumulated on Lightning AI by doing free work for them some time ago. If you know anyone with speech difficulties you can [let them know](https://mailchi.mp/0c6c7713ef3b/be-understood-speech-helper-app-email-waitlist) if they need speech recognition tool. It will listen to you and show a transcription on a screen

If you know a:
- person with speech disease
- caregiver
- speech therapist

and you think they could benefit from such tool, you can consider sharing the link to the [waitlist](https://mailchi.mp/0c6c7713ef3b/be-understood-speech-helper-app-email-waitlist)
